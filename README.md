# my_malloc
Recoding the C malloc function which allocates the requested memory and returns a pointer to it

#USAGE
First, you have to get the owner rights of the exec.sh file. In order to do that, tap the following command your Command Line Interface:
chmod exec.sh 755

Once the first step is done, we are now able to execute the program with a command like: ./exec.sh [Files or "Command with double quotes"]
For example, I am executing a command that shows rights of each files and folders of the computer, last time they were modified,
group and user names, and other things, all that in a recursive way:
./exec.sh "ls -lRt /"

Let's have Fun and enjoy !
